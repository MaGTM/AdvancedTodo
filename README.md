## Technologies

1. React
2. Material UI
3. OOP
4. Jest

## Purpose

I wanted to do this project to improve my skills in using React, Material UI, and Jest. I have been interested in these
technologies for a while, and I wanted to put my knowledge to the test by building a project using them.

One of the main reasons I chose to use Material UI was because it is a popular and well-documented library for building
user interfaces with React. It has a lot of pre-designed components that make it easy to create a professional-looking,
responsive interface. I also wanted to practice using Jest, which is a powerful testing framework that helps ensure that
my code is correct and reliable.

I also used OOP principles in building this project. I wanted to practice applying these principles to my code, as they
can help make it more organized and maintainable. I believe that using good software design practices is an important
part of creating high-quality code, and I hope that this project will help me improve my skills in this area.
